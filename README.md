# Movie Gallery

## Description

Create your own: Feeling artistic? Design your own movie poster with a title, genre, and description using our easy-to-use form.

Make changes: No worries if you make a mistake! You can easily update movie information through the edit form on the details page. The form will even pre-fill the details for you to make edits quicker.
